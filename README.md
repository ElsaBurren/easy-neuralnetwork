# easy-neuralnetwork
An easy neural-network class coded in Python. Hopefully, it helps to understand neural-networks better.

It is still work in progress! 

At the moment, there are two .py files. 

1) myNN.py: contains the classes, you may let Python interpret this file directly to see examples.

2) myNNApp.py: a sketch for how to load and use the myNN.py classes.

I wrote both files for Python 3.7.
